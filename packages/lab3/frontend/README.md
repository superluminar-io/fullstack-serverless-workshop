# Demo Frontend App

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run `npm start` to run the app in development mode. Do not forget to install all dependencies via `npm i` in the very beginning.

ðŸ‘‰ This demo app can be used to work on our [frontend workshop](https://frontendworkshop.superluminar.io).
